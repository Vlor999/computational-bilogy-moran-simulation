# Lab 1 : Moran process

## Questions:
Q1. Implement the simulation of a Moran process as discussed in the lecture (two genotypes differing from a neutral mutation with 0.5 starting frequency for each), and test (for several values of population size) whether the dynamics looks like the experimental data discussed in the lecture. Describe the outcome with an appropriate graph.

Q2. What is the distribution of the lifetimes of the individuals, in terms of number of simulation steps? How to convert between simulation steps and biological time?

Q3. As discussed in the lecture, modify the simulation to take into account a beneficial effect of the mutation, and describe the outcome with grahpics of your choice (in particular, describe is the effect of population size). We suggest the following parameters: the mutation confers a growth advantage of 10% relative to the wild type, does not impact longevity (/ death probability), and is initially rare.
